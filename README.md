# MY NEW EXPERIENCE IN INDUCTION PROGRAM 💗

# Date 31-July-2025
# Day1

# INTRODUCTION ABOUT ME 💁:-
My name is Khushi, and I am a first-year B.Tech CSE student. This induction program has been one of the most valuable experiences for me, and I would like to take this opportunity to share it with all of you.

## 8:30 to 9:30 

# AT GURUDWARA SAHIB 🛐:-
My first day at GNDEC began with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib. I offered my prayers, seeking blessings for the new journey I was about to embark on. I observed that the structure of the Gurudwara resembled the shape of a ship, which I found truly fascinating. One of my teachers mentioned that the ship-like design symbolizes the journey of life — a meaningful reflection as I take my first steps into this new chapter.

 ## 9:30 to 10:00 

 # TEA🧋 & SNACKS🥪 TIME 
After the prayers, we proceeded to an area where refreshments were served. We were offered beverages along with samosas, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The seniors who were serving us were exceptionally courteous and assisted everyone with great care.

In the afternoon, students participated in an orientation session within the CSE department, exploring its classrooms and laboratories. The faculty provided a comprehensive overview of the department’s infrastructure, technical facilities, and the diverse learning opportunities available for future academic pursuits.
