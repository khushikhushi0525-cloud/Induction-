# AT GURUDWARA SAHIB:-
My First day at GNDEC started with Gurudwara Sahib. I prayed at Gurudwara Sahib for my new journey which is about to begin. I notice the shape of Gurudwara is like a ship. This very interesting for me and My teachers say to me this Gurudwara Sahib shape like your life journey.
