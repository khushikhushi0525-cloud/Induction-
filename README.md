# MY NEW EXPERIENCE IN INDUCTION PROGRAM 💗

# INTRODUCTION ABOUT ME 💁:-
My name is Khushi, and I am a first-year B.Tech CSE student. This induction program has been one of the most valuable experiences for me, and I would like to take this opportunity to share it with all of you.

## 8:30 to 9:30 

# AT GURUDWARA SAHIB 🛐:-
My first day at GNDEC began with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib. I offered my prayers, seeking blessings for the new journey I was about to embark on. I observed that the structure of the Gurudwara resembled the shape of a ship, which I found truly fascinating. One of my teachers mentioned that the ship-like design symbolizes the journey of life — a meaningful reflection as I take my first steps into this new chapter.

 ## 9:30 to 10:00 

 # TEA🧋 & SNACKS🥪 TIME 
After the prayers, we proceeded to an area where refreshments were served. We were offered beverages along with samosas, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The seniors who were serving us were exceptionally courteous and assisted everyone with great care.
