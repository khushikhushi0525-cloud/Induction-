# AT GURUDWARA SAHIB:-
My first day at GNDEC began with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib. I offered my prayers, seeking blessings for the new journey I was about to embark on. I observed that the structure of the Gurudwara resembled the shape of a ship, which I found truly fascinating. One of my teachers mentioned that the ship-like design symbolizes the journey of life â€” a meaningful reflection as I take my first steps into this new chapter.
